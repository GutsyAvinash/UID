	            <br />  <h1 align="center">Welcome to the Unique ID Portal</h1>
	            <br /><br />
      <p align=center>    We have a very simple procedure for getting the unique ID.

          This includes a simple form to enroll your present address details.

<br />          Please enter your address details very carefully at first step.
          You are not allowed to proceed further untill you enroll yourself in the address <br />form.

          After completing the form , you will proceed to stage 2.

          Note that the details you entered are stored, after you click the "submit" button.
<br />
          If you want to change the details entered , you should go to your profile to edit Address details.

          Please enter the verification details, and wait<br /> for verification to complete.

          You will receive your reference number at your mail.

          Please, test the reference number by typing it in the test box.<br />
          Now submit your originals at your nearest agent's area, along with your reference number.

          The agent will check your verification status using<br /> the reference number, and verifies the originals again.

          The agent will also scan your originals and take a picure of yours.

          After taking your<br /> picture, he will give your Unique ID card and update it to your account.

          That is how you get an Unique ID . If your unique ID is lost, you can<br /> claim an duplicate one.

          That facility is also there in the website. The website will give you more support on your Unique ID.
